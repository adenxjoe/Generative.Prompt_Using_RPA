# RPA Project: Simultaneous Search in Google Gemini and Claude AI

## Overview

This project leverages Robotic Process Automation (RPA) using UiPath Studio to automate the process of searching a user-provided prompt in both Google Gemini and Claude AI. The generated responses from these platforms are then sent to the user's email address. This automation helps streamline the process of gathering information from multiple sources and delivering it directly to the user.

## Features

User Input Prompt: Collects a search prompt from the user.
Simultaneous Search: Automates searches in Google Gemini and Claude AI.
Email Delivery: Sends the collected responses to the user’s email address.

## Prerequisites

UiPath Studio: Ensure that UiPath Studio is installed on your machine.
Email Account: A configured email account to send responses.
API Access: Access to Google Gemini and Claude AI APIs (if applicable).

## Usage
Start the UiPath Project:

Run the project from UiPath Studio.
Enter the Prompt:

When prompted, enter the search prompt and the user’s email address.
Automated Search:

The automation will perform searches in Google Gemini and Claude AI simultaneously.
Email Delivery:

The responses from both searches will be compiled and sent to the provided email address.
